## Neovim IDE for Markdown code

An **experimental** IDE project for writing documentation in Markdown code. The project uses the new plugin manager [rocks.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim).  
**Rocks.nvim** differs from other plugin managers in its underlying philosophy, which is that writing the basic configuration (*dependencies*, *basic options*, and so on) is the developer's job and not the user's. This allows the end-user to have a simpler initial experience, while advanced plugin customization with the configuration files is still possible.  
An infrastructure created by developers for distributing plugins from the [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/neorocks) portal ensures that packages are first tested before their release. This differs from other plugin managers that use the individual project pages for downloading plugins. As a result, the release of new versions usually occurs later than the changes made to the projects, but tends to introduce far fewer errors to the end-user's environment.

## Purpose of the project

To provide as comprehensive an editor as possible for writing Markdown documentation for Rocky Linux. To this end the goals are:

- Automatic setting of Neovim options for Markdown files
- Highlight Markdown tags in the buffer
- Offer a zen mode for document editing
- Offer custom snippets for writing **mkdocs-material** tags in addition to standard Markdown tags

### Prerequisites

- A Linux distribution installed and configured as a desktop version. This guide uses Rocky Linux and consequently should work correctly on all RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linuxâ„¢) derivatives. For installation on other distributions refer to the relevant documentation.
- Proficiency in performing command-line commands
- Ability to run some commands as root user or with administrator permissions

### Prerequisites for Neovim, Lua, and Rocksmarker

The project requires some specific dependencies. In particular, you must have version ==Lua 5.1==. Versions provided by Rocky Linux are not supported.  
Version 5.1 is necessary for the proper functioning of *rocks.nvim*, which handles plugin management and also ensures full compatibility with the version used by Neovim.

From Neovim docs:

> The Lua 5.1 script engine is builtin and always available.

This project requires additional packages from the [CRB repository](https://wiki.rockylinux.org/rocky/repo/#notes-on-crb) (CodeReady Builder) to function properly, such as the *ninja-build* package. This repository provides common tools for code development. In Rocky Linux, you can enable this with the following commands:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y epel-release yum-utils
sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
```

When you have set up the sources, it is necessary to install some additional packages required for both building *Neovim* and installing the required Lua version. To install them on a Rocky Linux distribution type:

```bash
dnf install npm ncurses readline-devel icu ninja-build cmake gcc make unzip gettext curl glibc-gconv-extra tar git
```

When the installation finishes, you can move on to building the structure. This involves installing the *Neovim* editor as the first step.

## Installation of Neovim

*Neovim* is a modern, powerful and highly customizable text editor that provides a familiar experience for **vim** users.  
While maintaining the philosophy of **vim**, it simultaneously introduces improvements and features with the goal of providing a similar user experience but on a more modern code base.  
Its improvements include:

- **Improved stability**: A refactored code base to improve stability and performance.
- **Improved plugin system**: Neovim enables simplified plugin management by making it easier to extend its functionality.
- **Modern features**: Supports features such as asynchronous operations and better integration with other applications.

!!! note "Compiled version"

    You need version ==0.10.0== or higher of Neovim for the proper execution of Rocksmarker. Using the compiled version is recommended. The version provided by *EPEL* is outdated (0.8.0) and is not compatible with *rocks.nvim* and the plugins used.  
    More information can be found in the instructions in the [Quick Start](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md) section of the Neovim website.

Compiling Neovim from source presents no particular problems and is easy to perform if you meet the earlier requirements.

### Download the sources

The sources for Neovim are on *GitHub*. To retrieve the sources, you need to clone the repository locally. Do this by positioning yourself at the chosen location for the installation on your file system and then doing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
```

The command creates a `neovim` folder and downloads all the files inside it. When this process finishes, change to the newly created folder and switch to the ==stable== version with these commands:

```bash
cd neovim/
git checkout stable
```

!!! note ""

    Using the ==git checkout stable== command to place *git* in the stable branch before compilation ensures that the stable (recommended) version is used. If it is omitted, the compilation will perform on the development branch (currently 0.11).

### Compilation and installation (Neovim)

To compile do:

```bash
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```

The command calls *make* passing the **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE** flag that specifies the type of compilation.  
In particular, the **RelwithDebInfo** compilation produces fully optimized code, but it also builds the program database and inserts debug line information useful for any editor errors.

When the compilation finishes, it is possible to verify the correct execution of the new build without installing it. Neovim does not require external components to run. To test the newly compiled executable before replacing the one in use do:

```bash
./neovim/build/bin/nvim
```

When you have verified that Neovim is working properly, you can install it with *make install*. As with the Lua installation, this process copies the files to `/usr/local`. You must run the command as the *root* user, or with administrator permissions.

```bash
sudo make install
```

The installation creates ==nvim== within the $PATH, making it available for opening in a terminal. You can use this to check the installed version:

```bash
nvim --version
NVIM v0.10.4
Build type: RelWithDebInfo
LuaJIT 2.1.1713484068
Run "nvim -V1 -v" for more info
```

!!! tip "Removing Neovim"

    CMake target provides for the removal of all files installed with the ==make install== command:

    ```bash
    sudo cmake --build build/ --target uninstall
    ```

    It is therefore advisable to keep the folder with the sources for eventual removal.

Since the editor is ready to use, you can move on to installing the version of *Lua* corresponding to the one provided by *Neovim*.

## Installing Lua 5.1
  
The plugin manager chosen to configure additional Neovim plugins (**rocks.nvim**), requires the installation of *Lua 5.1* to function properly and that it be the **default version** for that user space. It also requires the linking of version 5.1 *headers* files to those on the system.  

!!! note "Coexistence of multiple versions"

    One of the features of Lua, resulting from its development as an "embedded" language, is that it does not require external dependencies. As a result, different versions can coexist on the same system without conflicting.  
    For example, a desktop installation of Rocky Linux 9 provides version 5.4.4. It is still available for use by the various applications that require it, even though the default version is 5.1.

### Download the required version

Version 5.1 is available on the official Lua website on the [download](https://www.lua.org/download.html) page. You can download the latest updated version (currently ==5.1.5==) with the command:

```bash
curl -O https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.5.tar.gz
```

Verify the integrity of the package with the *sha256* utility by comparing the result of the following command with the *checksum* provided from the download site:

```bash
sha256sum lua-5.1.5.tar.gz 
2640fc56a795f29d28ef15e13c34a47e223960b0240e8cb0a82d9b0738695333  lua-5.1.5.tar.gz
```

After verification, unpack the compressed archive and change into the created folder:

```bash
tar xzf lua-5.1.5.tar.gz
cd lua-5.1.5
```

### Compilation and installation (Lua)

You should perform the installation as a system installation (in `/usr/local/`). This is to allow simplified configuration of *headers* files, so you need administrator permissions at this stage.

For proper compilation you need the additional *readline-devel* package from the official Rocky Linux repositories.

!!! note ""

    The package takes on this name in distributions derived from RHEL, but in others it is identified differently. Debian, for example, identifies it as *libreadline-dev*.

Build the version with:

```bash
make linux test
```

The command performs a requirements check and proceeds to compile the binaries. If everything finishes without errors, the terminal prints the following message:

> Hello world, from Lua 5.1!

You use the *make* system utility to install it. You must run this command as the *root* user or with administrator privileges:

```bash
sudo make install
```

The installation copies the 5.1.5 version files to the `/usr/local/` path, thus keeping them separate from the system version files installed by default in `/usr/`.  
This installs the following files:

- **lua** - **luac** -> `/usr/local/bin/`
- **lua.h** - **luaconf.h** - **lualib.h** - **lauxlib.h** - **lua.hpp** -> `/usr/local/include/`
- **liblua.a** -> `/usr/local/lib/`

!!! tip ""

    The compilation does not provide a utility for removal of the installation. You can remove them manually by deleting the files listed above.

### Version setting

If your system is a desktop version, a default version of Lua is most likely already installed. However, it is unlikely that this version matches the one you require, so you need to set the default version to point to the correct version.

!!! note "System installed version"

    The version installed on the system will surely be later than 5.1. It should be pointed out that versions after 5.1 are not considered stable because they are not compatible with each other.  
    To check the installed version, type:

    ```bash
    lua -v
    Lua 5.4.4  Copyright (C) 1994-2022 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
    ```

The entire project requires the stable version of Lua, used by both Neovim and rocks.nvim. It is imperative that the default version for the user profile is 5.1.  
To meet this requirement add an *alias* in *.bashrc* to tell the system the version to use as the default for that user space.
Open your `.bashrc` in an editor and add the following string:

```bash
alias lua=/usr/local/bin/lua
```

Save the file and run the *source* to reread the configuration with:

```bash
. ~/.bashrc
```

Once you re-read the file, verify the version change with:

```bash
lua -v
Lua 5.1.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
```

Every time you run the executable program, it will use the version in your `.bashrc` file instead of the system version.

### Add header files

Installing the required version is not sufficient for the configuration to work properly. The *rocks.nvim* plugin manager needs Lua's *headers* files to compile its version of *luarocks*.  
You must link the required library, **lua.h**, found in `/usr/local/include/` in the *headers* file search path (`/usr/include/`).

!!! warning ""

    The lack of this file does not allow the initialization script to compile *luarocks* which ends with an error aborting the entire process.

To link this, use one of the standard *luarocks* `/usr/include/lua/<number_version>` search paths linked to the folder with version 5.1 *headers* files in `/usr/local/include/`.

Doing this requires you to operate again as the root user or with administrator permissions. Change to the `include` folder:

```bash
cd /usr/include/
```

Create the `lua` folder and place yourself inside it; the `/usr/include/lua/` folder is not present on a Rocky Linux system, so you must create it.

```bash
sudo mkdir lua && cd lua
```

Then create the symbolic link to the `/usr/local/include/` folder.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/ 5.1
```

The command links the folder to where the *headers* files copied during the installation of Lua 5.1, to a folder named `5.1` created by the command itself.  
The folder naming is arbitrary but choosing to use the version number allows mnemonic recall to its contents, and more importantly, meets the requirements for *luarocks* path finding.

To verify, just list the `5.1` folder and the files contained in `/usr/local/include/` should appear:

```bash
ls -l /usr/include/lua/5.1/
total 52
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  5777 27 dic  2007 lauxlib.h
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 22299 11 feb  2008 luaconf.h
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 11688 13 gen  2012 lua.h
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root   191 23 dic  2004 lua.hpp
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root  1026 27 dic  2007 lualib.h
```

With this last step, the installation environment is complete. You have met all the necessary installation requirements, and can move on to installing the editor.

## Download the configuration

Although still under development, you can use the configuration daily to write and edit documentation written in Markdown. You can install it safely as the default configuration in the `.config/nvim` path.  
If you already have a Neovim configuration on your system for other purposes, there is the option of using *Rocksmarker* as a secondary editor. In this instance it allows you to use your currently installed configuration for your existing projects, and the Rocksmarker configuration for markdown.  
This method makes it possible to try *Rocksmarker* independently, to see whether it can be a useful tool for your daily work.

### Main editor

To install the configuration in the default Neovim location, clone the GitHub repository to the configurations folder `~/.config/` with the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ambaradan/rocksmarker.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Once finished, just run the standard Neovim command to start the installation:

```bash
nvim
```

### Secondary editor

If you prefer to test or use the configuration as a secondary configuration, use Neovim's variable *NVIM_APPNAME*. Use of this variable allows Neovim to pass an arbitrary name for searching the configuration files in `~/.config/` and for the subsequent creation of the shared file folder in `~/.local/share/` and the cache in `~/.cache/`.  
To set *Rocksmarker* as a secondary editor:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ambaradan/rocksmarker.git ~/.config/rocksmarker/
```

Once the clone is complete, start Neovim with the following command to begin the installation:

```bash
NVIM_APPNAME=rocksmarker nvim
```

!!! warning "Subsequent starts"

    If you choose this method, you must start the configuration each time with the command described above. Otherwise, Neovim will start using the default `~/.config/nvim` folder. To avoid typing the entire command each time, the recommendation is to create an *alias*.

    ```bash
    alias rocksmarker="NVIM_APPNAME=rocksmarker nvim"
    ```

## Installing the configuration

Starting Neovim with either of the two methods described, will begin the installation process managed by a *bootstrap* script that checks for the lack of the *rocks.nvim* plugin and proceeds to install it.  
The process first installs *luarocks* required as a dependency of the plugin and then the plugin itself. If all works correctly, it will ask you to press ENTER to continue.

Press ENTER or type command to continue 
```

The second step is to synchronize all configured plugins. Synchronization installs the plugins in the shared files folder in the path `.local/share/nvim/rocks/lib/luarocks/rocks-5.1/`.  
Responding with ++"Y"++ will begin the installation process of all configured plugins.

```text title="plugins sync"

[Y]es, (N)o:  
```

When the plugins installation completes, close the editor and reopen it to give Neovim a chance to load the new configurations. On the second startup, the *mason-lspconfig* and *mason-tool-installer* plugins install automatically the *language servers* (LSP), *linters*, and *formatters* necessary for the correct functioning of the editor. When the installation of the language servers completes, the editor is ready for use.

## Conclusions

Rocksmarker is a custom configuration of Neovim and integrates all of its features. It also provides many additional features for file management, git repositories, diagnostics, and more.  
You can find an overview of the shortcuts that activate the functions in the `/lua/mappings.lua` file.  
Alternatively, the ++space++ key activates the command menu in the lower right corner where it lists all available commands. Letters marked with a **+** provide additional selections. Selecting the corresponding letter switches to the context menu and returns to the main menu with ++back++ while ++"'"++ calls up the menu for buffer navigation.
